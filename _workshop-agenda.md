# Agenda and Links: Web App Development from Basically Nothing
*Karl Stolley, Illinois Institute of Technology*

This workshop will focus on **concepts**, **techniques**, and specific **tasks** for web application
development using the Ruby on Rails web development framework. The morning will be spent becoming
familiar with both your development environment (editor, command line, version control system, and
browser) and a basic Rails app (the one in this Git repository). The afternoon will be less
structured, giving you time to try out building your own app in Rails, which you should sketch
out, even if only in your head, over the lunch hour.
